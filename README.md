# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, I combined two datasets, schools_complete and students_complete to draw conclusions based on a dataframe analyzing scores in reading and writing based on metrics of different schools. 
Within the python file, there is an analysis of the overall success rates of different schools based on their overall passing rates. Through grouping schools by size, school type, and budget per student, an analysis can be conducted to show which are the best indicators of success. In this dataset, the data shows the best indication of success comes from the type of school: charter schools demonstrate a significantly higher passing rate than district schools. 
In this challenge, I utilized our class slack channel and Stack Overflow for help defining the bins and making sure the code ran smoothly. Besides these online sources, my EdX Justin helped me with the groupby function structuring.
